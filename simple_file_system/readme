Creating a Pseudo File System

The goal of the assignment is to implement a simple file system. For the purpose of the disk, you will be using a file and develop your file system on top of the file. You need to first implement following basic APIs which will help you in implementing the
File System APIs: 
1. int createSFS( char* filename, int nbytes) – returns a fileSystemId 
2. int readData( int disk, int blockNum, void* block) – returns the num. of bytes read and read them into a buffer pointed by block. 
3. int writeData(int disk, int blockNum, void* block) – writes that data in the block to the disk block blockNum. 

File System API: 

4. int writeFile(int disk, char* filename, void* block): write the buffer pointed by block. The same data should be recoverable by the file name. 
5. int readFile(int disk, char* filename, void* block): returns the data stored by the given file name. 

Organization: Use the inode design with bitmaps for your organization. 

Diagnostic APIs: 

6. void print_inodeBitmaps(int fileSystemId): prints the bitmaps of inodes 
7. void print_dataBitmaps(int fileSystemId): prints the bitmaps of data block 
8. void print_FileList(int fileSystemId): prints all the files in the file system 

Instructions:
1. The project can be done in a team of TWO or One.
2. All the code file names must be preceded by Rollno1_Rollno2. The Rollnos must be of the form YYxxx where YY refers to the year of enrollment. If you are going to upload a zip file then every code file in the .zip file must have roll numbers in the name as mentioned above. 
3. The assignment will not be evaluated if the instructions are not followed and no exceptions will be given.
