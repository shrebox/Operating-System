Implementation of Free List Manager

Tasks:

1. To implement a free list manager which keeps track of calls of malloc() and free().

2. The user interface should allow to issue a malloc() call for x bytes.
e.g $:> malloc 10 would result in a malloc call for 10 bytes.

3. The user interface should allow to issue a free call for any past malloc() call by index
e.g $:> free 2 will result in the free operation for the 2nd malloc call

4. The user interface should allow to print the free list
e.g.: $:> print will result in printing the past malloc calls (which are still allocated) in the order with size and pointer address information
