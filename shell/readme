Develop a basic Shell

Develop a basic shell. Your shell should launch in a separate window. The shell should also be able to handle CTRL-C elegantly i.e. it should not result in killing the shell. 

Functionalities expected:

cd, history, clear, piping, redirecting stdin and stdout (using > and <), kill, handling Cntrl+C, handling erroneous commands, handling return (enter), help which will list all the built-in commands implemented by your shell.
Use of fork, exec, wait etc.

No use of 'system' command - you have to write your own shell and not use existing shell.
